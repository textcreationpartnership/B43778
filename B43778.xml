            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEREAS by an Act made in the First Year of their Majesties Reign, Entituled, <hi>An Act for the better Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the Exportation of Wooll, and Encouraging the Woollen Manufactures of this Kingdom,</hi> it was, amongst other things, Enacted, That from thence forward it should and might be Lawful to and for any Person or Persons whatsoever, to Buy any of the said Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures; and the same freely, without any Molestation or Trouble whatsoever, to Export into divers Places beyond the Seas (whereof <hi>Hamburgh, Germany, Holland, Flanders</hi> and the parts adjacent are part) upon Payment of the usual Customs: Which Act was to Continue from thence to the End of this present Session of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>And whereas, upon a surmise, That the said General Liberty, granted by the said Act, hath occasioned a far greater Exportation of the said Wooller. Manufactures, and occasioned the Price of Wooll to rise, leave hath been given, by the Honourable House of Commons, to bring in a Bill for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing of the said General Liberty of Exportation.</p>
            <p>It is humbly hoped, That it will be made to appear to the said Honourable House, That the said General Liberty in and by the said Act Granted, hath not occasioned any greater Quantity of the said Manufactures to be Exported to the parts aforesaid, nor occasioned the price of Wooll to rise; but that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of such a Liberty will be very prejudicial to the Interest of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in general; And particularly, That it hath and will more and more les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen the imploying of <hi>English</hi> Shiping; That it will wholly remove the said Exportation, as it hath in a great measure already done, out of the Hands of <hi>English</hi> Merchants and Subjects, into the Hands and Power of Foreigners; That it will be very prejudicial to the Rights and Priviledges of the City of <hi>London;</hi> That it will Impoverish the Clothing Countries, and make the price of Wooll to fall; and, That it will not only lessen, but endanger the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Loss of the said Manufactures to this Kingdom, and the great Priviledges and Immunities which to the Honour and Profit of this Nation have been and may be acquired in the parts aforesaid, in and by a Regulated way of Trade in the said Manufactures, whereof the Nation in general, and every <hi>English</hi> Merchant and Subject in particular, may have the Benefit.</p>
            <p>That a Petition is prepared, subscribed by many <hi>English</hi> Merchants and others, praying leave to be heard against the said Bill.</p>
            <p>All which is most humbly recommended to the serious Consideration of every particular Member of this Honourable House, as being a Matter of great Moment and Consequence to the Trade and Interest of this Nation.</p>
